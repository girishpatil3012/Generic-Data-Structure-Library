# Generic-Data-Structure-Library

•	This project is considered as a library which contains generic implementations of all major types of data      
  structures.
•	We provide the readymade implementations of all fundamental as well as advanced operations on linear, non-linear     data structures in object oriented way.
• We provide the generic way of implementation so we can use the functionality for any type of data types.
• All the object oriented design policies are used in this project.
